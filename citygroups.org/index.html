        # On the web: <a href="http://citygroups.org">http://citygroups.org</a>
        
        CityGroups is a public directory of community groups for your city.
        
        ### What & Why
        
        *Connecting community organizers with community groups to improve cities.*
        
        In cities across the country, there is amazing work being
        done by community organizers to mobilize their neighbors
        and take on community problems.
        
        CityGroups is a searchable public directory which allows 
        community organizers and residents to find community 
        groups so that they can work together. 
        
        Like a wiki, city staffers and community members can 
        contribute and retrieve the data in the system. The goal
        is to promote and assist smaller, less-visible groups who
        do important work but require modern tools to publicize it. 
          
        CityGroups will help them work together and work better.
        
        
        ### Installation
        CityGroups is built with Drupal. CityGroups is an install profile.
        "Data-Wiki" is the backend & is a collaborative data collection platform.
        
        ### Requirements
        LAMP stack (or MAMP, XAMP etc.)
        MYSQL database
        
        
        1. Create your database in MYSQL.
        
        2. Download DataWiki codebase.
        <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/Data-Wiki ">https://github.com/codeforamerica/Data-Wiki </a> 
        (You can either download and unzip it, or clone it from github
        if you have git installed on your server.)
        
        * you may need to install geofield, geoPHP from source, and use the master branch.
        
        
        3. The DataWiki codebase goes in your web server.
        
        4. Visit the path of your server. You should be able to install it.
        Depending how you do your settings.php, you may need to visit
        yoursite/install.php
        
        You install this like you would any normal Drupal site, except that
        you will select "CityGroups" as the Install Profile on the install page.
        
        5. Follow the prompts.
