CityGroups
PRE-ALPHA

CityGroups is a public directory of community groups for your city.

It consists of a Drupal based collaborative data management tool (a "Data-Wiki")
and a CouchDB and Javascript/HTML5 front end for searching and displaying
groups. The Couch (which should have GeoCouch) will do some of the geospatial searching
and also provide an API for other applications to use, which will provide lists
of data.

The project is under active development this summer and yes, if you would like
this in your city, drop us a line.
